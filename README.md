# Sorting Algorithms in Python

This repository houses Python implementations of commonly discussed sorting algorithms, frequently encountered in interviews for both service and product-based companies.

## Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort:** Simple algorithm repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements.
- **Quick Sort:** Divide-and-conquer algorithm utilizing a 'pivot' for efficient sorting.
- **Selection Sort:** In-place comparison sorting algorithm dividing the list into sorted and unsorted sub-lists.
- **Merge Sort:** Divide-and-conquer approach breaking down the list into sub-lists and merging them.
- **Intersection Sort:** Uncommon algorithm sorting an array through intersection of two sorted arrays.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run individual sorting algorithms:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gopi76/Sorting-Algorithms.git
```
